Django Invoice (currently unstable)
===================================

General purpose invoicing app.

This app provides simple (but sufficient) Invoice model with export abilities.
The default export is into PDF but it's easy to write and use your own. The app is 
python 3 compatible, has full unicode fonts and ability to use company logo.

The model provides an option to use your own Address model via setting `INVOICE_ADDRESS_MODEL`
and Bank Account model via `INVOICE_BANK_ACCOUNT_MODEL`. Both settings the has to be a string
with full class name (e.g. "myproject.core.models.CompanyInformation").
The only rule for custom models is that it has to have a method `as_text` which returns unicode 
string with newline separators `\n`. Addresses will be used as contractor and subscriber. 

If BankAccount reference is presented then it will be rendered below contractor information with
*Variable symbol: {{ invoice.id }}*.

The invoice is intended to be referenced via foreign key from another model which handles
access policy and payments. These mechanisms are not provided in this app in favor of
generality.

Invoice has some interesting methods:

**invoice.export_bytes()** - returns bytes of rendered invoice

**invoice.export_response()** - returns HttpResponse with the invoice as an attachment

**invoice.export_file(basedir)** - saves the invoice into a file in basedir and returns absolute path to the file

**invoice.export_attachment()** - returns MIMEApplication usable in email ::

    email = EmailMessage(to=[email, ], subject="Invoice", text="Hello")
    email.attach(invoice.export_attachment())
    email.send()

Here we provide an example invoice generated from test

Exports module
-------------

Provides base class `Export` for overriding and `HtmlExport` class which is the
default exporter.
You can find class `PdfExport` in `exporters.pdf` which needs reportlab fot it's
functionality. Unfortunately the reportlab is not python3 compatible.
The exporter instance is stored as class attribute in `Invoice.exports`.
One can modify this attribute to substitute it's own exporter.
All Invoice's methods `export_*` will be functional the same. Here is a example ::

    from myproject import MyExporter
    
    order = MyOrder.objects.get(pk=1)
    order.invoice.export = MyExporter()

    email = EmailMessage(to=[email, ], subject="Invoice", text="Hello")
    email.attach(order.invoice.export_attachment())
    email.send()


TestApp
-------
We provide an example project. For running you need just django, reportlab and PIL installed.

There is currently only the admin interface which allows you to try to make your
own Invoices and export them via admin action. If you want to play with the 
admin, don't forget to syncdb first.

You can run tests from this example app. You can run the test ::

    python manage.py test invoice
